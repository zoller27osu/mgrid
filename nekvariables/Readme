Notes:
1. som_stuff should no longer be necessary. It should be left for backup use in
    case of the catastrophic failure of the scripts held here.
2. The scripts here should automatically call "module swap PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-pgi"
    for you if you indicate that you are on Blue Waters in step 1 of "How to use".

How to install:
1. Copy nekvariables to nek5_svn/trunk/tools/scripts/.
    (i.e. with "cp -rf nekvariables ~/nek5_svn/trunk/tools/scripts/.")

How to use:
1. Edit nek5_svn/trunk/tools/nekconfig with the request information.
2. Run maketools, makenek as normal.
3. Make additional changes to nekconfig as requested by the scripts.

nekvariables/copychanges.sh:
    Will copy changes to the files back to the installed nekvariables
